PayumBundle [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Payum/PayumBundle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Payum/PayumBundle) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/payum/payum-bundle/d/total.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/payum/payum-bundle) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/payum/payum-bundle/version.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/payum/payum-bundle)
===========

The PayumBundle adds support of [payum](https://github.com/Payum/Payum) lib to [symfony](symfony.com) framework.

The bundle allows you easy configure payments, add storages, custom actions/extensions/apis. 
Nothing is hardcoded: all payments and storages are added via _factories_ ([payment factories][payment-factories], [storage factories][storage-factories]) in the bundle [build method][payum-bundle].
You can add your payment this way too!

Also, it provides a nice secured [capture controller][capture-controller]. It's extremely reusable. Check the [sandbox][sandbox-online] ([code][sandbox-code]) for more details.
